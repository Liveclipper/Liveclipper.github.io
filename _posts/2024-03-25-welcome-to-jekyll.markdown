Yes welcome, i don't know how to write but let me try.

Liveclipper is an online platform that allows users to record youtubers livestreams.

Why the fuck do i need to record streams when they are available on youtube you may ask?

Well some youtubers delete their stream causing me and other to miss out on valuable content

I'll go over the technicalities of how we set this up in other blog posts.  But for now

Go to [Liveclipper](https://liveclipper.com) Make an account, setup a schedule and begin recording
